0709.4061v2,"Scaling Analysis and Application: Phase Diagram of Magnetic Nanorings
  and Elliptical Nanoparticles",2007,"The magnetic properties of single-domain nanoparticles with different
geometric shapes, crystalline anisotropies and lattice structures are
investigated. A recently proposed scaling approach is shown to be universal and
in agreement with dimensional analysis coupled with an assumption of {\em
incomplete} self-similarity. It is used to obtain phase diagrams of magnetic
nanoparticles featuring three competing configurations: in-plane and
out-of-plane ferromagnetism and vortex formation. The influence of the vortex
core on the scaling behavior and phase diagram is analyzed. Three-dimensional
phase diagrams are obtained for cylindrical nanorings, depending on their
height, outer and inner radius. The triple points in these phase diagrams are
shown to be in linear relationship with the inner radius of the ring.
Elliptically shaped magnetic nanoparticles are also studied. A new
parametrization for double vortex configurations is proposed, and regions in
the phase diagram are identified where the double vortex is a stable ground
state."
2302.07392v2,"Stress-Induced Transformations of Polarization Switching in
  CuInP$_2$S$_6$ Nanoparticles",2023,"Using the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach, we study stress-induced
transformations of polarization switching in ferrielectric CuInP2S6
nanoparticles for three different shapes: a disk, a sphere, and a needle.
Semiconducting properties of a nanoparticle are modeled by a surface charge
layer, whose effective screening length can be rather small due to the
field-effect. We reveal a very strong and unusual influence of hydrostatic
pressure on the appearance of polarization switching in CuInP2S6 nanoparticles,
hysteresis loops shape, magnitude of the remanent polarization, and coercive
fields, and explain the effects by the anomalous temperature dependence and
""inverted"" signs of CuInP2S6 linear and nonlinear electrostriction coupling
coefficients. In particular, by varying the sign of the applied pressure (from
tension to compression) and its magnitude (from zero to several hundreds of
MPa), quasi-static hysteresis-less paraelectric curves can transform into
double, triple, pinched, or single hysteresis loops. Due to the sufficiently
wide temperature and pressure ranges of double, triple, and pinched hysteresis
loop stability (at least in comparison with many other ferroelectrics),
CuInP2S6 nanodisks can be of particular interest for applications in energy
storage (in the region of double loops), CuInP2S6 nanospheres maybe suitable
for dynamic random access multibit memory, and CuInP2S6 nanoneedles are
promising for non-volatile multibit memory cells (in the regions of triple and
pinched loops). The stress control of the polarization switching scenario
allows the creation of advanced piezo-sensors based on CuInP2S6 nanocomposites."
1708.05609v1,"GFEM study of magnetohydrodynamics thermo-diffusive effect on nanofluid
  flow over power-law stretching sheet along with regression analysis",2017,"The present paper uses the Galerkin Finite Element Method to numerically
study the triple diffusive boundary layer flow of homogenous nanofluid over
power-law stretching sheet with the effect of external magnetic field. The
fluid is composed of nanoparticles along with dissolved solutal particles in
the base fluid. The chief mechanisms responsible for enhancement of convective
transport phenomenon in nanofluids - Brownian Motion, Diffusiophoresis and
Thermophoresis have been considered. The simulations performed in this study
are based on the boundary layer approach. Recently proposed heat flux and
nanoparticle mass flux boundary conditions have been imposed. Heat transfer,
solutal mass transfer and nanoparticle mass transfer are investigated for
different values of controlling parameters i.e. Brownian-motion parameter,
Thermophoresis parameter, magnetic influence parameter and stretching
parameter. Multiple regression analysis has been performed to verify the
relationship among transfer rate parameters and controlling parameters. The
present study finds application in insulation of wires, manufacture of tetra
packs, production of glass fibres, fabrication of various polymer and plastic
products, rubber sheets etc. where the quality merit of desired product depends
on the rate of stretching, external magnetic field and composition of materials
used."
2112.08660v1,"Equilibrium of Free Surfaces and Nanoparticles in Self-Consistent Field
  Theory of Block Copolymers",2021,"This work presents a general and unified theory describing block copolymer
self-assembly in the presence of free surfaces and nanoparticles in the context
of Self-Consistent Filed Theory. Specifically, the derived theory applies to
free and tethered polymer chains, nanoparticles of any shape, arbitrary
non-uniform surface energies and grafting densities, and takes into account a
possible formation of triple-junction points (e.g., polymer-air-substrate). One
of the main ingredients of the proposed theory is a simple procedure for a
consistent imposition of boundary conditions on surfaces with non-zero surface
energies and/or non-zero grafting densities that results in singularity-free
pressure-like fields, which is crucial for the calculation of forces. The
generality of the theory is demonstrated using several representative examples
such as the meniscus formation in the graphoepitaxy and the co-assembly of
""polarized"" nano-rods and diblock copolymer melts."
1207.2023v2,"Dynamic phase transition properties and hysteretic behavior of a
  ferrimagnetic core-shell nanoparticle in the presence of a time dependent
  magnetic field",2012,"We have presented dynamic phase transition features and stationary-state
behavior of a ferrimagnetic small nanoparticle system with a core-shell
structure. By means of detailed Monte Carlo simulations, a complete picture of
the phase diagrams and magnetization profiles have been presented and the
conditions for the occurrence of a compensation point $T_{comp}$ in the system
have been investigated. According to N\'{e}el nomenclature, the magnetization
curves of the particle have been found to obey P-type, N-type and Q-type
classification schemes under certain conditions. Much effort has been devoted
to investigation of hysteretic response of the particle and we observed the
existence of triple hysteresis loop behavior which originates from the
existence of a weak ferromagnetic core coupling $J_{c}/J_{sh}$, as well as a
strong antiferromagnetic interface exchange interaction $J_{int}/J_{sh}$. Most
of the calculations have been performed for a particle in the presence of
oscillating fields of very high frequencies and high amplitudes in comparison
with exchange interactions which resembles a magnetic system under the
influence of ultrafast switching fields. Particular attention has also been
paid on the influence of the particle size on the thermal and magnetic
properties, as well as magnetic features such as coercivity, remanence and
compensation temperature of the particle. We have found that in the presence of
ultrafast switching fields, the particle may exhibit a dynamic phase transition
from paramagnetic to a dynamically ordered phase with increasing ferromagnetic
shell thickness."
